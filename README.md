# Bandpass 2nd Order Sallen Key Solver
## EE 3028 Electric Circuits III Design Project

Chandler Stevens presents the Bandpass 2nd Order Sallen-Key Solver application.

Simply enter these 4 values:

- Corner Frequency in kHz (fo)
- Quality Factor (Q)
- Capacitance in nF (C)
- Passband Gain in V/V (k)

To solve these 8 values:

- Wo in radians per second
- A in V/V
- b
- R in kiloOhm 1% resistor
- R2 in kiloOhm 1% resistor
- RFB in kiloOhm 1% resistor
- Rb1 in kiloOhm 1% resistor
- Rb2 in kiloOhm 1% resistor
